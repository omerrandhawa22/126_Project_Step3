## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#in the original experiement were analyzing the effect on education level 
#in this step we will explore why or why not other variables might be better predictors
#in this case sex(a categorical variable will predict income)

income_data <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\Omer\\Desktop\\adult.csv")

#in this case the str function tells us the structure of data
str(income_data)


income_data[income_data == "?"]<-NA


#making sure the predictor is a factor and the income is stored as a binary
income_data$sex<-as.factor(income_data$sex)

income_data$income_binary <- ifelse(income_data$income == ">50K", 1, 0)
print(income_data)



fit<- glm(income_binary ~ sex, data = income_data, family = binomial)

summary(fit)
#the fitted model of this logistic regression indicates a positive slove and 
#the p value is 2*10^-6 which is much less than 0.05 indicating a strong linear relationship
#less likely that the b1 in this case is zero

#Since this is logistic regression we cant calculate R^2 however McFadden's pseudo
#R^2 is a good estimate

ll.null<-fit$null.deviance/-2
ll.proposed <- fit$deviance/-2

r_squared <-(ll.null-ll.proposed)/ll.null
print(r_squared)
#in this case the R^2 value is 0.0466 which is low indicating a low explanation for 
#variancein the response variable therefore for this logistic regression we cannot be sure 
#if the income is being fully explained by the predictor (sex) or another random factor

```
```{r}
#Since the last model had a low R^2 value we can try another variable which may also predict income
#Maybe hours per week on the job?

income_data$hours.per.week<-as.integer(income_data$hours.per.week)


log<- glm(income_binary ~ hours.per.week, data = income_data, family = binomial)

summary(log)

ll.null<-log$null.deviance/-2
ll.proposed <- log$deviance/-2

r_squared <-(ll.null-ll.proposed)/ll.null
print(r_squared)

#In this case the R^2 squared value is also low however slightly higher: 0.048

plot(income_data$hours.per.week,income_data$income_binary, main = "Linear Regression", xlab = "Predictor Variable", ylab = "Response Variable")

# Add the regression line to the plot
abline(log, col = "red")

# Add a legend if desired
legend("topleft", legend = "Regression Line", col = "red", lwd = 1)
